# Overview
This project aimed to develop a predictive model for milk quality using various factors such as pH, temperature, taste, odor, fat turbidity, and milk color. The logistic regression model built in this project achieved an accuracy of 78% in predicting the quality of milk samples. This model has practical applications in the dairy industry and can benefit both milk producers and consumers.

Milk producers can use the model to assess the quality of their milk and make informed decisions about production and processing. Consumers can also make informed decisions when purchasing milk based on its predicted quality. However, it is important to validate the model's performance on new, unseen data to ensure its generalizability before implementing it in practical applications.

Furthermore, there may be additional factors that influence milk quality beyond the scope of the factors considered in this project, which could be explored in future research. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning and predictive modeling in the dairy industry and highlights the importance of understanding the underlying factors that influence milk quality.

# The Dataset
This dataset is manually collected from observations. It helps us to build machine learning models to predict the quality of milk. This dataset consists of 7 independent variables ie pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity, and Color. Generally, the Grade or Quality of the milk depends on these parameters. These parameters play a vital role in the predictive analysis of the milk.

# Results
It was develop a logistic regression model for milk quality classification using various factors such as pH, temperature, taste, odor, fat turbidity, and milk color. Initially, I built a simple logistic regression model and performed k-fold cross-validation, which resulted in an accuracy score of 78.04%.

To improve the performance of the model, I then performed hyperparameter tuning and found the best hyperparameters for the logistic regression model, which were: {'C': 10, 'max_iter': 1000, 'penalty': 'l2', 'solver': 'sag'}. The best accuracy score achieved using these hyperparameters was 0.7851, which is slightly higher than the initial accuracy score.

Overall, the results indicate that the logistic regression model has potential for predicting milk quality based on the given factors, and the hyperparameter tuning has slightly improved the performance of the model.
